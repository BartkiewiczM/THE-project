# SubCard: A Financial Platform for the Next Generation

## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to create a platform that offers a payment card for children, teenagers, and young adults. The platform allows users to rent products and pay for service subscriptions. Parents provide funds through a subscription, and any unused funds are automatically invested in predefined ETFs, fostering financial education and savings. This project aims to democratize access to goods such as toys, electronics, and household appliances, while supporting financial education for young people.

## Key Features of the Platform

### Payment Card and Product Rental System

- Children, teens, and young adults can rent products from partner retailers (toys, electronics, household appliances) and pay for service subscriptions.
- Collaboration with retailers and rental platforms like toy clubs, electronics stores (e.g., Media Expert, x-kom), and household appliance providers.
- Long-term rentals ranging from several weeks to a few months.

### Automatic Investment Mechanism

- Unused funds from the current month are invested in ETFs selected by the parents.
- Users can track their savings and learn about investing.

### Parental Control

- Parents have full access to the transaction history of their children and can set spending and rental limits.
- Ability to monitor rented items, giving parents peace of mind.

### Gamification and Financial Education

- The platform incorporates gamification elements to motivate users to save and manage their funds responsibly.
- Rewards and badges for responsible money management, saving, and investing.

### Collaboration with Educational Institutions and NGOs

- Partnership with non-profit organizations and schools to promote financial education.
- Additional educational programs and workshops for young people can be offered, strengthening the platform’s role as an educational tool.

### Insurance for Rented Products

- The platform offers insurance options for rented products in case of damage or theft, minimizing risk for partner retailers.
- Insurance allows partners to offer higher-value items, increasing trust in the platform.

### User Segmentation and Personalized Offers

- Product offers and recommendations are tailored to the user’s age and needs, from toys for children, electronics for teens, to household appliances for young adults.
- Personalized offers increase user engagement and better meet their needs.

### Collaboration with Financial Institutions

- Partnership with financial institutions offering educational programs and investment tools for young users.
- Integration with financial institutions enables secure investment of funds and promotes responsible financial habits.

## Benefits for Retail Partners

## Risks and Challenges

- **User education**: The need to educate younger users about subscription services, rentals, and investing.

## Conclusion
